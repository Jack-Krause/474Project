# CS4740 Machine Learning Project
Locating roads to target for future concrete projects.
This is a proof-of-concept project for showcasing how ML can be leveraged in different ways.

## Data Attribution
Dataset originally published by Iowa DOT GIS Team, licensed under CC BY 4.0. Modifications may have been made.

## Results
Easy-to-read results will be posted ASAP.

## TL;DR
Using real DOT road data such as traffic volume, construction/resurface date, traffic size to predict the condition of the roads in the future.
This uses the simple machine learning model of Multiple Regression. More models will be added in the future.
